        I FIRST DISCOVERED film as a 25 year old art student in New York. It
        struck me then that film, the study of human drama in creative form,
        could be the ultimate medium of self-expression I was searching for.

          Having careered in many fields, from architecture and engineering to
          fashion, food, finance and consulting, none has proved as rewarding as
          understanding and sculpting human behavior and emotions through storytelling.<br>
          <br>
          I used to be obsessed with the American indie thinking man’s Sci-Fi;
          films that commonly explored a what-if situation based on a scientific
          concept.<br>
          <br>
          But as I survived each debilitating crisis: a divorce, losing a partner to
          cancer, I appreciate in real life, one of screenwriting’s major tenets -
          <a href="#CharacterTransformation" style="color:inherit"><i>character
          transformation.</i></a> I could no longer return to making pure fiction
          based on imaginary concepts.

          SCREENWRITING, THE CONCEPTION of story and drama, has became for me a

          <br>
          Today, I find myself increasingly drawn to
          <a href="#TrueStories" style="color:inherit"><b>true stories</b></a>

        THERE WAS A time when my life revolved around crewing on film sets. The
        love for filmmaking started out with the act of making films.<br>
        <br>
        <i>I figured out <b>what</b> I was passionate about.</i>

      <div class="collapse" id="collapseDiscoverWhy" aria-expanded="false">
        <p class="para">
          As the years passed, I realized that filmmaking was about storytelling.
          And it all began, ironically, outside the film set. In the writer’s
          seat.<br>
          <br>
          <i>I figured out <b>how</b> to go about fulfilling what I was
            passionate about.</i><br>
          <br>
          After making a few films and not totally loving it, it occurred to me
          that it didn’t matter if I could write and direct well. I was given a
          megaphone but I had no voice.<br>
          <br>
          <i>I couldn’t figure out <b>why</b> I was making films. I didn't know

          BEFORE FILM, I had given up on many things in life. Somehow, I
          couldn't seem to give up on film. Film was my art. <i>Art was my
          cause.</i> Serving that cause gave my life meaning.<br>
          <br>
          I was adamant that if I had to give up something, it was my
          relationships, including my marriage, in service of my art.<br>
          <br>
          At the turning point of my life, it hit me hard when I lost someone close
          to cancer. It struck me then that it wasn't about giving up anything.
          It was simply about giving. <i>Giving more of myself.</i><br>

        DO YOU HAVE 5 people in your life you can turn to, <b>whose perspectives
        you value,</b> within 48 hours of encountering a crisis?
      <p>

      <p class="para collapse" id="collapseWizards" aria-expanded="false">
        Are your 5 wizards <i>wired differently enough</i> from you, and from
        one another, such that their perspectives work in concert to illuminate
        your blind spots <b>holistically?</b><br>
        <br>
        Wizards <i>don't</i> have to be mentors or coaches. But they
        <b>shouldn't</b> be your father figure. You want a distinctive voice
        you trust. <i>Not the default voice you revere.</i> For some, their
        children are their wizards.<br>
        <br>
        Wizarding, unlike mentoring or coaching, is a two way street. <i>You can
        be a wizard to someone who's your wizard.</i> It's not about getting
        advice from a sage. Not about obtaining consensus. It's about variety.
        Because <i>variety induces holism.</i><br>
        <br>
        Who you choose to be your wizards is absolutely critical. So limit
        those voices to 5. Most would have trouble identifying 3. View each
        crisis as an opportunity to reinvent yourself when you consult your
        wizards, and when you are <i>someone else's</i> wizard. The desired
        outcome is <b>a lighter, enlightened mind.</b><br>

          Expecting the other person to get our point of view <i>when we want them

        MEDITATIVE SCREENWRITING TEACHER Jessica Hinds introduced the concept of
        the 5 prime emotional needs underlying every action that a character takes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Validation</b> - <i>to prove to yourself</i><br>
        <b>Respect</b> - <i>to prove to others</i><br>
        <b>Justice</b> - <i>to fight against injustice</i><br>
        <b>Love</b> - <i>to be with someone you love</i><br>
        <b>Comfort</b> - <i>to be in the company of friends</i><br>
      </p>

      <div class="collapse" id="collapseEmotionalNeeds" aria-expanded="false">
        <p class="para">
          Emotional needs are not tied to the nature of the action. <i>It's not
          about <b>what</b> you're doing but <b>why</b> you're doing what you're
          doing.</i><br>
          <br>
          If you're climbing Mount Everest, most would assume it’s for
          validation. That maybe true for most cases. Though you could be
          climbing Mount Everest for any of the following reasons:
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>To challenge yourself</i> - <b>Validation</b><br>
          <i>To gain the respect of others</i> - <b>Respect</b><br>
          <i>To champion a cause</i> - <b>Justice</b><br>
          <i>To be with your spouse</i> - <b>Love</b><br>
          <i>To be amongst friends</i> - <b>Comfort</b><br>
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          Some actions have up to three underlying emotional needs but one stands
          out as dominant.
        </p>

          TAKING THIS CONCEPT one step further and applying it to your life’s

          My primary emotional need in life began with <b>Respect</b> till my

          To see this powerful concept executed in screenwriting, a highly driven
          character (e.g. an entrepreneur) begins his journey with an objective -
          a notion of what he <b><i>wants.</i></b> He is undeterred from his
          goal. The audience roots for him because of his determination.<br>
          <br>
          By the end of his journey, he arrives at an <i>unexpected yet
          inevitable</i> conclusion that what he <b><i>wants</i></b> no longer
          matters. Instead he discovers what he <b><i>needs.</i></b> Usually
          something that fills an obvious emotional void. This bitter-sweet
          moment can be so unforgettable for the audience that it has the

          HERE'S A TRUE story. I was working on the screenplays of two
          <a href="#TrueStories" style="color:inherit">true stories</a> with
          extremely compelling causes when I found out that my partner was
          stricken with terminal cancer. It was a rare form of cancer that
          showed few external signs of debilitation. I took it for granted that
          she had a few more years.<br>
          <br>
          Given the extreme difficulties of getting a film produced, I plowed
          on my screenplay tirelessly, prioritizing art over love. Despite her
          pleas, I took off for a month to co-write with my writing partner in
          Los Angeles.<br>
          <br>
          When I returned, I was shocked to find her body muscles have atrophied
          beyond belief. Her condition declined rapidly thereafter. In a few
          months, I was overcame with shock when she could no longer recognize
          me. Shortly after, she passed on.<br>

          <i>Could I not have waited a year to make my trip to LA?</i><br>

          badly was to complete my screenplay. Call it Art. Ambition.
          Achievement. What I <b><i>needed</i></b> most was compassion.
          Regrettably, I learnt it the hard way and bore the brunt of a painful,
          irreversible transformation.

          BEING A DISRUPTOR is fashionable these days. But there's no

          what the industry <b>is not.</b><br>
          <br>
          <i>Apple</i> & <i>Virgin</i> are commonly referred to as lifestyle

          out of business. <i>Apple</i> & <i>Virgin</i> don’t.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Apple</i> & <i>Virgin</i> are grounded in their <b>cause</b> of
          challenging the status quo. Differentiation from their competitors is
          a result. Not a motivation. Beauty and innovation is an outcome. Not
          an impetus.<br>
          <br>
          If we consider <i>Apple</i> & <i>Virgin</i> as disruptors, we need to
          ask how many markets have they upended? Like a vigilante, a disruptor
          can be ignored.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Apple</i> & <i>Virgin</i> however, are <b>movements beyond a brand.</b>
          Their identities are moulded by a higher cause. Their achievements are

          I BEGAN COVERING Lim Seng's story as an independent filmmaker in early
          2018. Moved by his intention to inspire the next generation of
          Singaporeans to <i><b>take action</b></i> on their dreams, I came onboard
          <a href="//probono.zilem.studio" style="color:inherit">pro bono</a> as
          <a href="//branding.zilem.studio" style="color:inherit">brand strategist</a>
          to promote his <a href="//spaceman.zilem.studio/#CampaignVideo" style="color:inherit">cause.</a>
          His first attempt to launch a manned flight to space was on 15 May 2018
          from Alice Springs, Australia.<br>
          <br>
          In the days leading to the launch, Singapore’s first astronaut was
          revealed. Volunteers along with their family members and a news crew
          from Singapore showed up in the remote desert to show their support.
          Unfortunately, winter came early that year. Winds were too strong for
          a safe liftoff. Everyone went home with a heavy heart when <i>we
          failed to launch.</i> <br>
          <br>
          A year later, the team of volunteers and news crew reconvened in Alice
          Springs for the second attempt on 26 April 2019. Only this time, the
          team was smaller. Weather conditions were favourable leading up to the
          launch date. But owing to malfunctioning navigation equipment,
          once again, <i>we failed to launch.</i><br>
        </p>

        <p class = "firstpara">
          CONSIDERING THE CONSEQUENCE of failure for most startups rarely
          places a human’s life in harm’s way, Lim Seng has been rightfully
          prudent for safety reasons. However, patience was running thin amongst
          his volunteers. With two failed attempts to launch and social media
          deriding it as a scam, the <b><i>raison d'être</i></b> of the project
          and his credibility as <b><i>a man of action</i></b> were now being tested.<br>

        <font color="#c5000b">
        <h6 class="tagline" style="Line-Height:22px; text-transform:uppercase">
          His moral dilemma became about striking a balance between safety and credibility.</h6>

        <p class = "para">
          As it turns out, <i>safety</i> in a never been done before project
          like this one, can be a constant moving target. Within a fortnight,
          Lim Seng rallied his troops with the promise that he would launch on
          31 May 2019. Earnestly reaching out to every volunteer, he assembled a
          skeletal crew of nine for his third attempt. I was one of them,
          assigned to play an integral role in operations.<br>
          <br>
          A day prior to the launch, Lim Seng announced the inevitable. Given
          the risks involved, the most responsible course of action as campaign
          director was for him, the man who funded the venture and who engineered
          the spacecraft, to assume the role of astronaut provided he deemed it
          <i>safe enough</i> for launch. To him, it was. Finally,<br>

          AS THE LAUNCH kicked into high gear, unlike previous unmanned launches,
          every action from inflating the stratospheric ballon to stabilizing the
          spacecraft had tremendous consequence if gone wrong. <i>Simply because
          the stakes were so bloody high.</i> The payload wasn't a piece of test
          equipment. It was a living breathing human being! Who must return to
          Earth. Who must return alive.<br>
          <br>
          Murphy’s law <i>“anything can go wrong will go wrong”</i> interfered
          relentlessly. Upon liftoff, an unforeseen ground impact led to the
          loss of communications equipment. Worse, it compromised the integrity
          of the spacecraft. Depressurization kicked in. Mission was aborted
          thirty minutes later upon ascending to half the intended altitude.<br>
          <br>
          No one on the ground had an inkling if Lim Seng was alive for two
          harrowing hours since liftoff till search & rescue found him intact
          among the spacecraft debris. Many lessons were learned that day. <i>We

        STORY IS FOUND in the <i>history</i> that exists in every character,
        person or company. Identifying a good story is important. But it won’t
        matter unless you know how to <i><b>tell</b> it well.</i> Here’s an example.<br>
        <br>
        Spoilers ahead for the character of Jaime Lannister the Kingslayer in
        the popular TV series <i>Game of Thrones.</i><br>

          IN SEASON 1, Jaime Lannister is being introduced as the villain knight
          in shining armor who is caught in an incestuous act with his sister by a
          ten year old. Jaime pushes the boy from the window, crippling him
          for the rest of his life.<br>
          <br>
          A few episodes later, Jaime’s overbearing father berates Jaime for the
          shame he's harboured years after slaying the king he was sworn to
          protect. Jaime experiences brief moments of disillusionment about the
          notion of honour he’s meant to uphold as a knight.<br>
          <br>
          Throughout season 2 whilst being captured as a prisoner of war, Jaime
          sacrifices his cousin’s life in his attempts to escape. In the face
          of death, he continues to display malice, depravity and brutality -
          traits of the ultimate irredeemable character.<br>
          <br>
          After spending two seasons with Jamie Lannister, this is clearly
          someone who despite many life-changing experiences, including an
          interesting kingslaying <b>story,</b> remains largely a cardboard villain.<br>

          COME SEASON 3, the unimaginable happens. While being escorted by Brienne
          to the capital, they both get captured. Jaime defends Brienne from rape
          and consequently gets his sword hand chopped off. A fate far worse than
          death for a knight.<br>
          <br>
          With a severed hand dangling over his neck, he loses all sense of purpose,
          dignity and identity. He descends to an unforeseen state of vulnerability.
          Like a patient suffering from PTSD, he opens up to Brienne about a secret
          - he slayed the king to save his father and thousands of innocent lives.<br>

          he becomes a different man. He develops greater empathy for others,
          strives to act more honorably, and would go on to become a character
          that audiences root for.<br>

        IN AMERICA, THE gender discrimination faced by a White Female and
        the racial discrimination faced by an Asian Male both stem from a
        toxic white masculine culture.<br>
        <br>
        In Asia & Africa, a self-imposed discrimination aka “Colonial
        Disease” manifests itself in the local government favouring the
        White Man.<br>
        <br>
        In Singapore, Malay & Indian minorities struggle to conform under a
        certain "Chinese privilege" conferred to the Chinese majority, a
        variant of Sinocentrism experienced in China.

        For all that Singapore prides itself on innovation, is it destined

        Pragmatism is the modern day shackles we must break free of. We need
