      <p class="firstpara">
        WHEN I WAS young, I grew up with a cousin a few years older. He
        was practically my big brother. He behaved like one. He demanded to be
        respected like one.<br>
        <br>
        When I went overseas for my university and returned one summer, he
        observed that I spoke with an open mind. He said, <i>“I don’t like that
        you're better than me now that you've studied abroad.”</i><br>
      </p>

      <div class="collapse" id="collapseRespect" aria-expanded="false">
        <p class="para">
          When I started working, I quickly realised how much I hated
          corporate life. I went freelance in no time. Meanwhile, my cousin
          took to corporate like a duck to water. At the peak of his career, he
          had several hundred workers under him. He loved having that authority.<br>
          <br>
          Then all of that plateaued. He began dreaming about side projects to run.
          Since I was a freelancer, I encouraged him to be entrepreneurial. But
          corporate life was too comfortable for him to take any action. So those
          dreams remained largely as dreams.<br>
          <br>
          Once in a while, he contemplated business ventures that were quick
          paths to riches and bordering unethical. Thankfully his latent
          inertia got the better of him.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="firstpara">
          WHEN HE FINALLY took action, it was on a truly revolutionary product.
          I supported him wholeheartedly. I got him to consider launching it on
          Kickstarter and offered to make the marketing video for him. For free.<br>
          <br>
          I shared many of my creative ideas. Because of his technical
          background, he didn’t appreciate any of them. All he wanted was a
          boring, technical, cookie-cutter video.<br>
          <br>
          So  I procrastinated. For weeks. Finally, I confronted my own
          inaction. And it hit me like a lightning bolt.
        </p>
        <br>

        <font color="#c5000b">
        <h6 class="tagline" style="Line-Height:22px; text-transform:uppercase">
          I was seeking respect from him.</h6>
        </font>
        <br>

        <p class = "para">
          I have been seeking respect from him for the last thirty years. And no
          matter how hard I try, I’m never gonna get it. Because he’s never gonna
          give it to me. Not for this project. Not ever. Then I unearthed
          something even deeper.
        </p>
        <br>

        <font color="#c5000b">
        <h6 class="tagline" style="Line-Height:22px; text-transform:uppercase">
          I wanted him to take action so that I can finally respect him.</h6>
        </font>
        <br>

        <p class = "para">
          Realising this sent chills down my spine. Clearly, this relationship
          wasn’t going to work. Neither party respected the other. But why? Why
          had I been oblivious to this? For thirty years?<br>
          <br>
          I questioned myself rigorously. The result was a framework for
          evaluating deep collaborative relationships. We know it comes down to
          respect.
        </p>

        <font color="#c5000b">
        <h6 class="tagline" style="Line-Height:22px; text-transform:uppercase">
          But what should we respect someone for?</h6>
        </font>
        <br>

        <p class = "firstpara">
          WE ALL KNOW genuine respect is not earned through status, power or wealth.
          Turns out we don’t respect someone simply for knowledge, seniority or
          even character. We respect someone for what he/she stands for. <b>To us.</b><br>
          <br>
          My cousin probably thinks he stands for authority. Several hundred men
          under him. He needed that respect. But to me, he stands for <i>shortcuts.</i>
          Whereas I stand for <i>meaning.</i> The pursuit of deeper meaning in life.
          And no way you gonna get there via shortcuts.<br>
          <br>
          I realised I had to distance myself from him. Imagine that pain. He was
          my big brother! My only regret was it took me thirty years to realise this.
