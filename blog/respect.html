      </font>
      <p class="firstpara">
        I HAVE NO siblings. When I was young, I grew up with a cousin three
        years older than me. He was practically my big brother. He behaved like
        one and demanded to be respected like one.<br>
        <br>
        When I went overseas for my university and returned one summer, he
        noticed that I spoke with an open mind. To that he said, <i>“I don’t
        like that you're better than me now that you've studied abroad.”</i><br>
        <br>

        <div class="collapse" id="collapseRespect" aria-expanded="false">
          <p class="firstpara">
            WHEN I STARTED working, I realised to my horror that I  absolutely hated
            the corporate life. After two years, I quit and went freelance. Meanwhile,
            my cousin took to corporate life like a duck to water. At one point, he had
            several hundred workers under him. He absolutely loved that authority.<br>
            <br>
            Then all of that plateaued. He began dreaming about side projects to run.
            Since I was a freelancer, I encouraged him to be entrepreneurial. But
            corporate life was too comfortable for him to take any action. So those
            dreams remained largely as dreams.<br>
            <br>
            Once in a while, he contemplated business ventures that processed the
            by-products of his employer. Except he wouldn't declare his interest in them.
            Not only was it illegal, it was highly immoral. Thankfully his latent
            inertia got the better of him.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p class="firstpara">
            WHEN HE FINALLY took action, it was on a revolutionary product that
            didn’t involve his employer. I supported him wholeheartedly. I got him
            to consider launching it on Kickstarter and offered to make the
            marketing video. For free.<br>
            <br>
            I shared many of my creative ideas. Because of his technical
            background, he didn’t appreciate any of them. All he wanted was
            for me to make a boring, technical, cookie-cutter video.<br>
            <br>
            I procrastinated. For weeks. Finally, I confronted my own
            inaction. And it hit me like a lightning bolt.
          </p>
          <br>

          <font color="#c5000b">
          <h6 class="tagline" style="Line-Height:22px; text-transform:uppercase">
            I was seeking respect from him.</h6>
          </font>
          <br>

          <p class = "firstpara">
            I HAVE BEEN seeking respect from him for the last thirty years. And no
            matter how hard I try, I’m never gonna get it. Because he’s never gonna
            give it to me. Not for this project. Not ever. Then I unearthed
            something even deeper.
          </p>
          <br>

          <font color="#c5000b">
          <h6 class="tagline" style="Line-Height:22px; text-transform:uppercase">
            I wanted him to take action so that I can finally respect him.</h6>
          </font>
          <br>

          <p class = "para">
            Realising this sent chills down my spine. Clearly, this relationship
            wasn’t going to work. Neither party respected the other. But why? Why
            had I been oblivious to this? For thirty years?<br>
            <br>
            I questioned myself rigorously. I came up with a framework for
            evaluating deep collaborative relationships. We know it comes down to
            respect.
          </p>

          <font color="#c5000b">
          <h6 class="tagline" style="Line-Height:22px; text-transform:uppercase">
            But what should we respect someone for?</h6>
          </font>
          <br>

          <p class = "firstpara">
            WE ALL KNOW genuine respect is not earned through status, power or wealth.
            Turns out we don’t respect someone simply for knowledge, seniority or
            even character. We respect someone for what he/she stands for. <b>To us.</b><br>
            <br>
            My cousin probably thinks he stands for authority. Three hundred men
            under him. He needed that respect. But to me, he stands for <i>shortcuts.</i>
            Whereas I stand for <i>meaning.</i> The pursuit of deeper meaning in life.
            And no way you gonna get there via shortcuts.<br>
            <br>
            I realised I had to cut him off from my life. Imagine that pain. He was
            my big brother! I went ahead anyway. I mentally severed my ties with him.
            My only regret was it took me thirty years to realise this.
