      </font>
      <p class="firstpara">
        I have no siblings. When I was young, I grew up with a cousin who was 3
        years older than me. He was practically my big brother. He behaved like
        one and demanded to be respected like one.<br>
        <br>
        When I went overseas for my university education and returned one summer,
        he noticed that I spoke with an open mind and he didn’t like it. He said,
        <i>“I don’t like that just because you have the opportunity to study
        overseas, that now you’re better than me.”</i>  If I confronted him
        about this today, he probably wouldn’t recall any of it.<br>

        <p class="para collapse" id="collapseRespect" aria-expanded="false">
        When I started working, I realised to my horror that I  absolutely hated
        the corporate life. I quit after 2 years and went freelance. Meanwhile,
        my cousin took to corporate life like a duck to water. In his early 30s,
        he rose rapidly through the corporate ranks. At one point, he had
        several hundred workers under him. He absolutely loved that authority.<br>
        <br>
        Then all of that plateaued for him. And he started to dream of side
        projects to run. Since I was a freelancer, I encouraged him
        to be entrepreneurial. But corporate life was too comfortable for him to
        take any action. So those dreams remained largely as dreams.<br>
        <br>
        Once in a while, a couple of these projects involved setting up businesses
        that processed the by-products of the company that he worked for except
        he wouldn't declare his interest in them. He saw an opportunity that was
        clearly a conflict of interest. Not only was it illegal, it was highly
        immoral. Thankfully he didn’t take action on these either.<br>
        <br>
        When he finally took action, it was on a revolutionary product that
        didn’t involve the company he worked for. So it’s legit. I supported him
        wholeheartedly. I got him to consider launching it on Kickstarter and
        offered to make the marketing video for him. For free.<br>
        <br>
        I shared many of my creative and marketing-oriented ideas with him. But
        because of his manufacturing background and technical training, he didn’t
        appreciate any of these ideas. He didn’t see the need to develop a
        marketing strategy. All he wanted was for me to make a technical, boring,
        cookie-cutter video.<br>
        <br>
        I procrastinated. For weeks. Finally, I confronted myself about my own
        inaction. I started by asking what I stood to gain from being a part of
        this project.<br>
        <br>
        1. Gain experience working the Kickstarter platform.<br>
        2. Gain experience working on a commercial end-user product.<br>
        3. Prove my worth to a big brother.<br>
        <br>
        That last one hit me like a lightning bolt. I was seeking respect from
        him. I have been seeking respect from him for the last 30 something years.
        And guess what? I’m never gonna get it. Because he’s never gonna give it
        to me. Not for this project. Not ever.<br>
        <br>
        Then I unearthed something even deeper. Perhaps it was me. All these years,
        I wanted him to take action on his dreams so that I can finally respect
        him. Realising this sent chills down my spine.<br>
        <br>
        Clearly, this relationship wasn’t going to work. Neither party respected
        the other. But why? Why was I oblivious to this for the last 30 years?<br>
        <br>
        I questioned myself rigorously. And I came up with a solution. A framework
        for evaluating deep collaborative relationships. We know it comes down to
        respect. But what should we respect someone for?<br>
        <br>
        We all know genuine respect is not earned through status, power or wealth.
        Turns out we don’t respect someone simply for knowledge, seniority or
        even character. We respect someone for what he/she stands for. <b>To us.</b><br>
        <br>
        My cousin probably thinks he stands for authority. Three hundred men
        under him. He needed that respect. But to me, he stands for <i>shortcuts.</i>
        Whereas I stand for <i>meaning.</i> The pursuit of deeper meaning in life.
        And no way you gonna get there via shortcuts.<br>
        <br>
        I realised I had to cut him off from my life. Imagine that pain. He was
        my big brother! I went ahead anyway. I mentally severed my ties with him.
        My only regret was it took me over 30 years to realise this.
