      <p class="firstpara">
        LITTLE Chye huddles in a corner of his bed. Traumatized. He hears his
        older brother Moss whipped and punched by their father for hanging
        out with gangs. Just another day in the life of this low-income
        Singapore family during the 70s.<br>
        <br>
        One day, little Chye returns home to find Moss taken away by police for
        heroin possession. Witnessing his father abuse his mother for negliglence,
        little Chye musters his courage. Stands up to his old man for the first
        time. In that moment, he learns to stand up for the weak.

      <p class="firstpara">
        AT 20, Chye, enrols in the University of Western Australia as a
        psychology major; the start of his journey of self-discovery. Working
        hard labour jobs to pay the bills, Aussies pick on him for no reason
        other than being Asian. Broken knuckles and a near loss of an eye
        prompts him to learn martial arts to defend himself.

      <br><br>
      <font color="#c5000b"><h6 class="tagline"><u>CONFORMIST</u></h6></font>
      <p class="firstpara">
        AFTER graduation, Chye becomes fortuitously employed as a high level
        corporate executive in Singapore. For once in his life, he is able to
        amass wealth and finds love. Four years into his marriage with Jenny,
        at the brink of a divorce, they decide to salvage the marriage with a
        child. Nicole is born. To Jenny’s dismay, Nicole becomes the centre of
        Chye’s life, prompting Jenny to desert them both once and for all.

      <br><br>
      <font color="#c5000b"><h6 class="tagline"><u>ACTIVIST</u></h6></font>
      <p class="firstpara">
        QUITTING his corporate job, Chye becomes a full time Dad to shower
        Nicole with the love he never received as a child. Meanwhile, he puts
        his psychological training to use; counseling rape and sexual assault victims.<br>
        <br>
        One day, he receives news that a street attack has left Moss in a coma.
        Grieving over Moss' plight, Chye discovers his calling. He travels
        around the world to learn true self-defence. Returns to Singapore
        to found Asia’s largest realistic self-defence movement to protect and
        empower women.

      <p class="firstpara">
        EIGHT years go by. Chye’s self-defense academy prospers. A new challenge
        arises. Chye receives a letter from Jenny’s lawyer petitioning for
        custody of Nicole. When the subordinate courts rule that Nicole is to
        be assigned to her mother, the heartbreak of being deprived of the one
        person he can’t live without drives him to take matters into his own
        hands...
