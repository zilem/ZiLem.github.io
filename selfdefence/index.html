        AS the youngest growing up in a family of domestic abuse, Chye feels helpless in protecting his mother and his middle brother Moss from his abusive father. That is until he learns Taekwondo. Since young, he is impressed upon by Moss’ mantra - “We must find a way out of this shit hole.”

Seeking refuge in drugs, Moss finds a sense of belonging with gangs and eventually becomes a prison-bound criminal. Meanwhile, Chye gets his break studying psychology in Australia, where frequent fights and injuries lead him to question marital arts as an adequate form of self-defence.

20 years later, Chye is a successful corporate executive and a single father fresh from a divorce. One day, he receives news that a street attack on Moss has left him in a coma. Thereupon, he discovers his calling to save lives, abandons his career to embark on learning and teaching the most effective techniques of self-defence, culminating with the art of killing.

Eight years after deserting her own daughter, Chye’s ex-wife returns to demand custody of Nicole. When the court rules that Nicole is to be assigned to her mother, the heartbreak of being deprived of the one person he can’t live without drives him to take matters into his own hands.
